# Problem Statement
A food delivery service is facing challenges in achieving profitability across its operations. With a dataset of 1,000 food orders, the service aims to understand the dynamics of its cost structure and profitability to identify strategic opportunities for improvement. The goal is to conduct a detailed cost analysis, evaluate profitability, and recommend strategies to improve profitability, including finding a "sweet spot" for commission and discount percentages.

# Approach Followed
Data Loading and Preparation: The food orders dataset was loaded and preprocessed. This included converting date and time columns to datetime objects and extracting numerical values from the 'Discounts and Offers' column to calculate the actual discount amount for each order.

Cost and Profitability Calculation: Total costs per order were calculated by summing delivery fees, payment processing fees, and discount amounts. Revenue per order was considered to be the commission fee. Profit per order was then calculated as Revenue minus Total Costs.

Overall Metrics Analysis: Aggregated metrics for total orders, total revenue, total costs, and total profit were calculated to get an overview of the service's financial performance.

Profitability Distribution Visualization: A histogram was generated to visualize the distribution of profit per order, providing insights into the frequency of profitable and unprofitable orders.

Cost Breakdown Visualization: A pie chart was created to show the proportion of different cost components (Delivery Fee, Payment Processing Fee, and Discount Amount) contributing to the total costs.

Total Revenue, Costs, and Profit Visualization: A bar chart was used to visualize the overall total revenue, total costs, and total profit for all orders.

Identifying Profitability Drivers: To find a "sweet spot" for commission and discount percentages, the dataset was filtered to include only profitable orders. The average commission percentage and the average effective discount percentage for these profitable orders were calculated.

Strategy Recommendation: Based on the analysis of profitable orders, recommended commission and discount percentages were proposed.

Impact Simulation: The profitability of orders was simulated using the recommended commission and discount percentages.

Simulation Visualization: A kernel density estimate (KDE) plot was generated to compare the distribution of actual profitability with the simulated profitability using the recommended rates.

# Outcome
The analysis revealed that a significant portion of orders were unprofitable, largely due to the impact of discounts. The cost breakdown showed that discounts constituted the largest proportion of total costs. By analyzing profitable orders, it was found that these orders had a significantly higher average commission percentage (around 30.5%) and a lower average discount percentage (around 5.9%) compared to the overall averages.

Based on these findings, a strategy recommending a commission rate closer to 30% and a discount rate around 6% was proposed. The simulation of this strategy indicated a potential shift towards higher profitability per order, with a greater proportion of orders becoming profitable. This suggests that adjusting commission and discount strategies based on the insights from profitable orders could significantly improve the overall profitability of the food delivery service.
